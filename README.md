# Code Structure with Swapi

## Description

Using the Swapi tool, a small project was carried out to formalize the code structure or syntax to be used for future projects.

This structure, which advocates the Clean Architecture methodology, has its pillar in the layered structure. It also takes advantage of the TDD (Test Driven Development) methodology.
